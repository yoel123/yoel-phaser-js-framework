i ported my game framework to phaser js.
when i have more time i will write tutorials on how to use it.
it works almost the same as my dom js engine. you can take a look at it:

https://github.com/yoel123/yoel-html5-game-engine-tutorials

each file contain an example usege of my frameworks features.

the "1)template" is a template of the framework if you want to create a project.
to use phaser you will need a server (or a local server like wamp).


soon i will create written and video tuts for it.

if theirs any mistake or something you dont understand please contact me.
